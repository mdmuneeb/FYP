we are using ensemble learning. so my project works in a way that first i have the Yolov8 seg model that detects the grains from the image and output a segment and a box around the grain. then we run the script that basically crop each grain on the basis of the bounding box the Yolo has created. then each grain move to 3 models in parallel EfficientNetV2-S, MobileNetV2, ResNet18. these are classifiers model that basically which grain belongs to which class. then as a meta layer we have XGBoost which works on the basis of voting. we have trained these model in a way that for Yolo we have created dataset manually meaning we took pictures and then labeled them manully. then for CNN layers we gave the raw pictures to the Yolo and then generate the output (bounding box) then we crop the each grain from the image using crop script. as we have the raw images like raw_dataset/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) and inside each folder we have images of the classes. the output from the crop script like CNN_dataset/test/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) and CNN_dataset/val/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) so this is basically we created the dataset for the CNNs using the Yolo and crop script and folder name will be working like the label and inside the images will be used for training. In this way we have trained the CNNs, the noisy images were removed manually. Now for XGBoost we make its dataset like we have the folder CNN_dataset/test/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) and CNN_dataset/val/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) but these are images and XGBoost needs tabular data for training thats why we gave the above folder structure to the CNNs and make the predictions from them in this way we got these folders images CNN_dataset/test/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) and CNN_dataset/val/IRRI-6(folder_1), 1509(folder_2), Super White(folder_3) in the tabular form. then we analyze the data and remove the rows that predictions was less than 0.6, this has been done using data visualization. for the unknown class we did that we make the threshold that if any grain predictions are below 0.6 then this class would be marked as the unknown class.
